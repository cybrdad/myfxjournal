A very easy to use journal software for a forex trading journey.
While using Excel intensively and ending with like 30 or 40 columns and lot of calculus everywhere, I wanted something simple and with a friendly user interface, and developped this one and decided to make if free to download.

Note: Im kinda new here and not a professional developer; I didnt really understand how one can manage the stuffs or a project; I then tried to upload the exec files and all must be in the same folder, as long as the unzipped runtimes.zip, to run correctly. It was made with MS WPF and need the dotnet framework v8.
