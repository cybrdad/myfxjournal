A very easy to use journal software for a forex trading journey.
While using Excel intensively and ending with like 30 or 40 columns and lot of calculus everywhere, I wanted something simple and with a friendly user interface, and developped this one and decided to make if free to download.
It was made with MS WPF and needs the dotnet framework v8 to run properly.

Note: the backtest example project provided with the software does not reflect a real forex trading session, it is provided for demonstration purpose only.
