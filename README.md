A very easy-to-use journaling software for a forex trading journey.
Using Excel intensively and ending with like 30 or 40 columns and lot of calculus everywhere, I wanted something simple with a friendly user interface, developed this one and decided to make if free to download.
It needs the dotnet framework v8 to run properly.

Note: the backtest example project provided with the software does not reflect a real forex trading session, it is provided for demonstration purpose only.
Thanks for your suggestions / feedback (cybrdad@outlook.com). If you are a super profi trader, and if I made some mistake or error, let me know.
